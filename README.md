# LR-Rental-house-price
In this project, I aim to analyze the rental price data of houses in various regions of Tehran using machine learning, specifically regression methods. The dataset has been collected from the Divar website and pertains to the end of the Persian year 1399. This is my first machine learning project, and to accomplish it, I have utilized the codes and data provided by Mr. Amir Ali Madadi (https://github.com/amiralimadadi), which were shared on his GitHub page.

Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Amir Ali Madadi for making this data and his knowledge accessible. This project would not have been possible without his contribution.
